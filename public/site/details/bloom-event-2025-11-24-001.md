# Microsite and evergreen contract published

We stood up the Bloom Filter Lab microsite at `stainlessray.com/public/site/` with a contract-compliant index and narrative details.

## What changed
- Added a styled `index.html` that introduces Bloom filters, variants, CLI usage, and the educational path, drawing from ABOUT_BLOOM_FILTERS.md and EDUCATIVE.md.
- Published `index.json` (evergreen array) with the launch card pointing to this markdown detail.
- Created `details/bloom-event-2025-11-24-001.md` (this file) to document the rollout.

## How to use it
- Browse the homepage for a high-level overview, commands, and roadmap.
- Consume `index.json` for card metadata; modals should render markdown from `details/…`.
- Host and fetch from `stainlessray.com/public/site/` so `${BASE_URL}/index.json` and `${BASE_URL}/details/bloom-event-2025-11-24-001.md` remain reachable.

## Notes and follow-ups
- Additional cards can capture v0.1.1 demo features, standardized ingestion, and roadmap milestones.
- Add resources to `paths.resources` if new HTML views are placed beside `index.html`.
