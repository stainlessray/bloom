# Bloom Filter 
### Intent
At a high level:
A <em>Bloom filter</em> is a <em>probabilistic data structure</em> used to test whether an element <em>is</em> in a set — with no false negatives (if it says “no,” the item’s definitely not there) but possible false positives (it might say “yes” when the item isn’t actually there).
